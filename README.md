# ML-Robustness-Fairness

Fairness - Robustness - Interpretability project. 

We are working with this dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ictinstitute/utrecht-fairness-recruitment-dataset?resource=download

## Utrecht Fairness Recruitment dataset

This dataset contains the recruitment decisions of four companies over 500 candidates. For each candidate we have a few general descriptions (gender, age, sport) and a few indicators. The actual decision is also included. The data set can be used to get basic data science experience, but also to gain a deeper understanding of fairness.

### Basic data science

The dataset is synthetic and it is suggested that students pick one company and build a prediction model for that company. This can be done via decision trees, logistic regression, neural networks or other methods and if you allow all indicators to be used, should give good results.

### Understanding fairness

The recruitment decisions of the companies show different amounts of bias, that students can analyse. There are multiple variables for which bias can be analysed: gender, nationality, age and sport. if your model uses any of these as input values, your model might also be biased and you can analyse and perhaps correct this.
